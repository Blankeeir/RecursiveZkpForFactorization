# Recursive Zkp For Factorization
a demo for recursive zero-knowledge proof with underlying proof of integer multiplication and factorization
## Proof logic
implementing a ZKP for integer factorization: proving knowledge of two integers *p* and *q* such that *p Ã— q = N*, without revealing *p* and *q*.

**Recursive zk-Proofs** take this a step further by allowing a proof to verify another proof within itself. This enables scalable and efficient proof systems, as multiple proofs can be aggregated into a single proof.
